# ADR-0001: Use ECS Fargate with DynamoDB for Infrastructure Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context

We need to design a cloud infrastructure architecture for the ecs-fargate-infra project that meets the following requirements:

- **Cost Optimization**: Must operate within AWS Free Tier limits for demo/development workloads
- **Container Support**: Should leverage containerized application deployment
- **Managed Services**: Prefer AWS managed services to reduce operational overhead
- **Scalability**: Support auto-scaling capabilities for future growth
- **Development Focus**: Optimized for development and demonstration use cases

Several architectural approaches were evaluated:

1. **ECS Fargate with RDS PostgreSQL**: Traditional 3-tier architecture
2. **Serverless with Lambda + DynamoDB**: Event-driven serverless approach
3. **ECS Fargate with DynamoDB**: Hybrid container + NoSQL approach
4. **Single EC2 instance**: Simple monolithic deployment

## Decision

We will implement **ECS Fargate with DynamoDB** as the primary infrastructure architecture.

### Core Components:
- **Container Orchestration**: Amazon ECS with Fargate launch type
- **Database**: Amazon DynamoDB with single-table design
- **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Networking**: VPC with single AZ deployment
- **Logging**: CloudWatch with 7-day retention
- **Secrets**: Systems Manager Parameter Store

### Resource Specifications:
- **ECS Tasks**: 0.25 vCPU, 512MB memory (minimum Fargate allocation)
- **DynamoDB**: On-demand billing with always-free tier (25GB + 25 RCU/WCU)
- **ALB**: Single load balancer with SSL termination
- **VPC**: Single AZ with public subnets (no NAT Gateway)

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

**Cost Optimization**:
- DynamoDB always-free tier provides persistent storage without consuming time-limited RDS free tier hours
- ECS Fargate 20GB-hours monthly allocation sufficient for development workloads
- Single AZ deployment eliminates cross-AZ data transfer costs
- Auto-scaling to zero during off-hours minimizes compute costs

**Technical Benefits**:
- Container-based deployment maintains development workflow flexibility
- Fargate eliminates server management overhead
- DynamoDB provides automatic scaling and high availability
- ALB provides health checks and SSL termination out of the box

**Operational Advantages**:
- All managed services reduce operational complexity
- CloudWatch integration provides comprehensive monitoring
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) enables reproducible deployments
- Auto-scaling capabilities support varying workloads

### Negative Consequences

**Technical Limitations**:
- DynamoDB NoSQL model requires different data modeling approach compared to relational databases
- Single AZ deployment sacrifices high availability for cost optimization
- Limited to DynamoDB query patterns and access patterns
- Minimum Fargate resource allocation may be over-provisioned for small applications

**Operational Considerations**:
- DynamoDB requires understanding of NoSQL design patterns
- Free Tier monitoring necessary to avoid unexpected costs
- Limited to specific AWS services (vendor lock-in)
- Container images must integrate with DynamoDB SDK

**Cost Risks**:
- Exceeding Free Tier limits incurs charges
- Data transfer charges for external API calls
- CloudWatch log ingestion limits (5GB/month)
- Potential charges for backup and advanced DynamoDB features

### Migration Path

If requirements change, the architecture supports evolution:

**To High Availability**: 
- Expand to multi-AZ deployment
- Add RDS with Multi-AZ configuration
- Implement cross-region disaster recovery

**To Serverless**:
- Migrate ECS tasks to Lambda functions
- Replace ALB with API Gateway
- Maintain DynamoDB data layer

**To Traditional Architecture**:
- Replace DynamoDB with RDS PostgreSQL
- Migrate data using DynamoDB export/RDS import tools
- Update application data access layer

### Monitoring and Validation

**Success Metrics**:
- Monthly AWS costs remain under $10 (Free Tier + small buffer)
- Application deployment time < 10 minutes
- Auto-scaling responds to load within 5 minutes
- 99.9% uptime during business hours

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Daily cost monitoring with CloudWatch
- Free Tier usage tracking and alerting
- Regular architecture reviews at 3-month intervals
- Cost threshold alerts at 80% of budget
