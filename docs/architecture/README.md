# Architecture

System architecture, diagrams, and design documents.

## Architecture Documents

*Architecture documents will be added here as they are created.*

## Planned Documents

- **system-overview.md** - High-level system architecture
- **component-diagram.md** - Component relationships and interactions
- **data-flow.md** - Data flow through the system
- **deployment-architecture.md** - AWS infrastructure layout

## Guidelines

- Include diagrams where helpful (store in `assets/images/`)
- Link to relevant ADRs for architectural decisions
- Keep documents updated as the system evolves
- Use consistent terminology and naming conventions
